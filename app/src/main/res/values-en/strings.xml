    <!-- Characteristic descriptions (speech / voice) -->
    <string name="desc_jitter_local">Local jitter — short-term instability of fundamental frequency (F0). Reflects micro-fluctuations in voice pitch from period to period. Elevated values may indicate voice tremor.</string>
    <string name="desc_jitter_abs">Absolute jitter — absolute difference between adjacent fundamental frequency periods. Measure of irregularity of vocal fold oscillations over time.</string>
    <string name="desc_jitter_ppq5">Jitter PPQ5 — measure of fundamental frequency stability averaged over five periods. Used to assess voice tremor.</string>
    <string name="desc_ppe">PPE (Pitch Period Entropy) — entropy of fundamental frequency period. Characterizes irregularity and unpredictability of vocal fold oscillations.</string>
    <string name="desc_shimmer_apq11">Shimmer APQ11 — amplitude instability of voice averaged over 11 periods. Reflects volume change from cycle to cycle.</string>
    <string name="desc_shimmer_apq3">Shimmer APQ3 — amplitude instability of voice over three periods. Shows short-term amplitude fluctuations.</string>
    <string name="desc_shimmer_db">Shimmer (dB) — amplitude variation of voice in decibels. High values may indicate volume instability.</string>
    <string name="desc_shimmer_local">Local shimmer — short-term amplitude instability. Reflects volume change between adjacent periods.</string>
    <string name="desc_hnr">HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio) — ratio of harmonic energy to noise in voice. Characterizes voice clarity and sonority; decrease may indicate hoarseness.</string>
    <string name="desc_f1">F1 — first formant. First peak in vowel spectrum, related to tongue position and height.</string>
    <string name="desc_f2">F2 — second formant. Second peak in vowel spectrum, related to tongue front-back position and vowel articulation.</string>
    <string name="desc_f0_range">F0 range — difference between maximum and minimum fundamental frequency in recording. Reflects voice pitch mobility.</string>
    <string name="desc_intensity_range">Intensity range — difference between maximum and minimum volume in recording. Reflects voice volume dynamics.</string>
    
    <!-- About Activity -->
    <string name="about_text">About\n\nThe app is intended for preliminary analysis of speech features that may indicate Parkinson\'s disease using machine learning algorithms. This app is not a medical device and is not intended for diagnosis. Results must not be used for treatment decisions. If in doubt, consult a physician. For the most accurate results, it is recommended to record speech in a quiet environment using a quality microphone.\n\nModels\n\nModel accuracy was determined by 10-fold cross-validation. The vowel phonation model has accuracy 80.76% ± 9.66% and was trained on 496 recordings (24 PD patients, 22 healthy). The speech model has accuracy 96.53% ± 1.18% and was trained on 22582 recordings (441 PD patients, 286 healthy).\n\nSources\n\nhttps://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/italian-parkinsons-voice-and-speech\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/patient-health-detection-using-vocal-audio?resource=download\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/489/parkinson+dataset+with+replicated+acoustic+features\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/189/parkinsons+telemonitoring\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/470/parkinson+s+disease+classification\nhttps://openslr.org/60/\nhttps://openslr.org/45/\n\nSource code\n\nhttps://github.com/Nickronus/parkinsons_disease_identifier\n\nLicense\n\nGNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3\nhttps://github.com/Nickronus/parkinsons_disease_identifier/blob/main/LICENSE\n\nAuthor\n\nNikita Golubev\nnickronus@mail.ru\n\nVersion: 1.0</string>
